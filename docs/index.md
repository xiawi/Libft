# ðŸ§° libft

Welcome to the documentation for **libft**, the foundational library of the 42 curriculum.

`libft` is a personal implementation of a subset of the standard C library functions, including string manipulation, memory handling, character checks, and linked list utilities. It serves as the first major C project and lays the groundwork for deeper understanding of low-level programming.
